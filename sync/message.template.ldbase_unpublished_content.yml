Add as much metadata as possible, to make it more findable by others.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>You always have the option to share the metadata of your project without sharing the actual data (data is the file you are uploading, for example: a dataset, a document, or a code script). You can do this in one of two ways:</span><ol><li>&nbsp;<span>Publish your Project Page, but do not publish the Dataset/Document/Code Page until you are ready</span></li><li><span>Publish your Project and your Dataset/Document/Code Pages, but put an embargo on the actual data file. Embargoing allows you to share all of the information (metadata) about your content without sharing the actual data. You can find detailed instructions about embargoing your data once you have clicked on the “I will upload..” button on your Dataset/Document/Code Page. You may also refer to our FAQs to learn more about this functionality.</span></li></ol></li></ul><p><span>This is an automated message from the LDbase repository.
